# AI Image Generation and Style Transfer

This project provides a collection of AI-based tools for generating images, creating avatars, and applying style transfers. The tools are powered by various state-of-the-art AI models, including **Stable Diffusion**, **StyleGAN2**, and **TensorFlow-based Style Transfer**.

## Features

1. **Stable Diffusion (Text-to-Image Generation)**  
   Generate high-quality images from text prompts using the Stable Diffusion XL model.

2. **StyleGAN2 (Avatar Generation)**  
   Generate realistic avatars using the StyleGAN2 model by providing random latent vectors.

3. **Style Transfer (Image Style Transfer)**  
   Apply artistic styles to images using the Magenta Arbitrary Image Stylization model.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10
- PyTorch (with CUDA support for GPU acceleration)
- TensorFlow (for Style Transfer)
- Required libraries:
  - `torch`
  - `torchvision`
  - `diffusers`
  - `transformers`
  - `tensorflow`
  - `tensorflow-hub`
  - `opencv-python`
  - `PIL` (Pillow)
  - `numpy`
