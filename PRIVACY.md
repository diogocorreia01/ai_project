**Effective Date**: 15 March 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, uses, and protects the personal data of users ("you" or "your") who use our application ("App").

## Information We Collect

We do not collect or store any personally identifiable information when you use the App, unless explicitly stated otherwise.

### 1. User-Provided Information
- **Prompt Information**: When you generate an image, you may enter text prompts that we use to process the image. These prompts are processed solely to generate the requested image and are not stored or shared beyond the application.
  
### 2. Automatically Collected Information
- **Device Information**: When you use the App, we may collect information about your device, including hardware model, operating system, application version, and crash logs. This information helps us improve the performance and functionality of the App.
  
- **Usage Data**: We may collect information on how you interact with the App, such as the time spent generating images, the models used, and other similar analytics. This data is collected for performance improvements and to understand how users interact with the App.

## Use of Information

We may use the collected information for the following purposes:
- To process image generation requests and provide the requested functionality.
- To improve the user experience, app performance, and overall service quality.
- To troubleshoot technical issues.

## Data Retention

We do not retain any personal data related to your prompts or usage after the processing is complete. Any data collected during your session (such as device information or usage data) is only retained for as long as needed to provide the functionality and improve the App.

## Data Sharing and Disclosure

We do not share your personal information or any data provided by you to third parties unless required by law or to comply with legal obligations.

## Security

We take reasonable precautions to protect your personal data. However, no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## Your Rights

You have the right to:
- Access, update, or delete any personal information provided through the App, although, as noted above, we do not store this information beyond the current session.
- Opt out of any data collection features in the App if available.
